# Consensus History

## Consensus History List

The Consensus History API provides a stream of aggregate forecasts derived from forecasts submitted in the HFC benchmark condition. Each time a user submits a forecast in the benchmark condition, the consensus forecasts for that question's answers are recalculated. This endpoint provides a historical record of each consensus forecast change.

Within HFC, the consensus is calculated using an aggregation algorithm called logit. The logit aggregation method is an extremizing method that uses a weighted geometric mean to aggregate forecasts. Forecaster weights are calculated based on 3 factors: historical accuracy, the frequency with which the forecaster updates his or her forecasts, and whether the forecaster completed a training course.

When accessing this API, use the `created_after` parameter to pull only those records that have been created since you last accessed the API. **Do not attempt to pull** every record/page of the history, except the first time you hit the API. The data will not change after creation.

Prior to question/answer resolution, the most recent (as determined by `consensus_at`) record can be considered the current consensus for that answer.

### Value vs. Normalized Value

Each record contains two value fields: `value` and `normalized_value`. The `value` field is the raw output from the aggregation algorithm, while the `normalized_value` is the `value` field normalized to ensure the answer options in a question sum to 100%.

### Decay & Weighting

Records contain parameters indicating decay and weighting settings that were used to calculate the consensus. Decay settings generally work by subsetting the individual-level forecasts that are fed to the aggregation algorithm. Weighting applies different weights to different forecasters when calculating the consensus (e.g. more accurate forecasters may have their opinions weighted more heavily).
