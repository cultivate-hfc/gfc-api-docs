# Prediction Sets

The Prediction Sets API provides a stream of individual-level forecasts submitted by users in the HFC benchmark condition. Each prediction set will contain one prediction for each answer in the question.

If you want to connect all forecasts made by a given forecaster, you can do so using the `membership_guid`. This field is a unique identifier for a given forecaster. For example, if John Doe has a `membership_guid=cc4c30df5539f534690f0a36209738ce78a04180`, then all of John Doe's forecasts will contain that same value.
